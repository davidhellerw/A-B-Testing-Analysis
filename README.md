# A/B Testing Analysis: User Experience Improvement

## Project Overview

This project evaluates the effectiveness of a new user interface (UI) design implemented by Vanguard, a financial services company, using an A/B testing approach. The main goal is to determine whether the new design leads to improvements in user engagement, completion rates, and overall user experience compared to the old design.

## Project Components

### 1. Data Preparation and Exploration

- Merging and preprocessing datasets containing user interaction data.
- Exploring data distributions, missing values, and general trends.

### 2. Completion Rates Analysis

- Calculating completion rates for each variation group (control and test).
- Analyzing completion rates by gender and age groups within each variation group.
- Visualizing completion rates for better insights.

### 3. Time Spent Analysis

- Calculating and comparing the average time spent on each step between variation groups.
- Analyzing time spent on each step transition.
- Visualizing time spent on each step to identify efficiency improvements.

### 4. Error Rates and Step Abandonment Analysis

- Calculating error rates and step abandonment rates for each variation group.
- Visualizing error rates and step abandonment rates to assess the impact of the new design on user experience.

### 5. Statistical Testing

- Conducting hypothesis testing to determine the statistical significance of observed differences.
- Testing for completion rate increase exceeding a predefined threshold.
- Assessing group distribution equality between variation groups.

### 6. Experiment Evaluation

- Evaluating the experiment's structure, randomization, and duration.
- Providing insights into the reliability and validity of the experiment results.
